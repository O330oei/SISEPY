Subject: tracing: Disable trace_printk() on post poned tests
Git-commit: 78041c0c9e935d9ce4086feeff6c569ed88ddfd4
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc4
References: git-fixes

The tracing seftests checks various aspects of the tracing infrastructure,
and one is filtering. If trace_printk() is active during a self test, it can
cause the filtering to fail, which will disable that part of the trace.

To keep the selftests from failing because of trace_printk() calls,
trace_printk() checks the variable tracing_selftest_running, and if set, it
does not write to the tracing buffer.

As some tracers were registered earlier in boot, the selftest they triggered
would fail because not all the infrastructure was set up for the full
selftest. Thus, some of the tests were post poned to when their
infrastructure was ready (namely file system code). The postpone code did
not set the tracing_seftest_running variable, and could fail if a
trace_printk() was added and executed during their run.
