Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/realtek - Enable the headset mic on Asus FX505DT
Git-commit: 4963d66b8a26c489958063abb6900ea6ed8e4836
Patch-mainline: v5.7-rc2
References: bsc#1051510

On Asus FX505DT with Realtek ALC233, the headset mic is connected
to pin 0x19, with default 0x411111f0.

Enable headset mic by reconfiguring the pin to an external mic
associated with the headphone on 0x21. Mic jack detection was also
found to be working.
