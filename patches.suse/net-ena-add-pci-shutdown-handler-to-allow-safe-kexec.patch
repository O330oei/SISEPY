Subject: net: ena: Add PCI shutdown handler to allow safe kexec
Git-commit: 428c491332bca498c8eb2127669af51506c346c7
Patch-mainline: v5.6
References: bsc#1167421, bsc#1167423
Acked-by: Jiri Bohac <jbohac@suse.cz>

Currently ENA only provides the PCI remove() handler, used during rmmod
for example. This is not called on shutdown/kexec path; we are potentially
creating a failure scenario on kexec:

(a) Kexec is triggered, no shutdown() / remove() handler is called for ENA;
instead pci_device_shutdown() clears the master bit of the PCI device,
stopping all DMA transactions;

(b) Kexec reboot happens and the device gets enabled again, likely having
its FW with that DMA transaction buffered; then it may trigger the (now
invalid) memory operation in the new kernel, corrupting kernel memory area.

This patch aims to prevent this, by implementing a shutdown() handler
quite similar to the remove() one - the difference being the handling
of the netdev, which is unregistered on remove(), but following the
convention observed in other drivers, it's only detached on shutdown().

This prevents an odd issue in AWS Nitro instances, in which after the 2nd
kexec the next one will fail with an initrd corruption, caused by a wild
DMA write to invalid kernel memory. The lspci output for the adapter
present in my instance is:

00:05.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Amazon.com, Inc. Elastic Network
Adapter (ENA) [1d0f:ec20]
