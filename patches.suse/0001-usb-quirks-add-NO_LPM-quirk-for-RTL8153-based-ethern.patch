Subject: [PATCH] usb: quirks: add NO_LPM quirk for RTL8153 based ethernet
 adapters
Git-commit: 75d7676ead19b1fbb5e0ee934c9ccddcb666b68c
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc7

We have been receiving bug reports that ethernet connections over
RTL8153 based ethernet adapters stops working after a while with
errors like these showing up in dmesg when the ethernet stops working:

[12696.189484] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
[12702.333456] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
[12707.965422] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout

This has been reported on Dell WD15 docks, Belkin USB-C Express Dock 3.1
docks and with generic USB to ethernet dongles using the RTL8153
chipsets. Some users have tried adding usbcore.quirks=0bda:8153:k to
the kernel commandline and all users who have tried this report that
this fixes this.

Also note that we already have an existing NO_LPM quirk for the RTL8153
used in the Microsoft Surface Dock (where it uses a different usb-id).

This commit adds a NO_LPM quirk for the generic Realtek RTL8153
0bda:8153 usb-id, fixing the Tx timeout errors on these devices.
